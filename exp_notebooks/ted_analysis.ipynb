      "Thank you so much Chris And its truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice Im extremely grateful I have been blown away by this conference and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night And I say that sincerely partly because Mock sob I need thatPut yourselves in my positionI flew on Air Force Two for eight yearsNow I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplaneIll tell you one quick story to illustrate what thats been like for meIts a true story  every bit of this is trueSoon after Tipper and I left the  Mock sob White House we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville Driving ourselvesI know it sounds like a little thing to you but I looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me There was no motorcade back thereYouve heard of phantom limb painThis was a rented Ford TaurusIt was dinnertime and we started looking for a place to eat We were on I40 We got to Exit 238 Lebanon Tennessee We got off the exit we found a Shoneys restaurant Lowcost family restaurant chain for those of you who dont know it We went in and sat down at the booth and the waitress came over made a big commotion over TipperShe took our order and then went to the couple in the booth next to us and she lowered her voice so much I had to really strain to hear what she was saying And she said Yes thats former Vice President Al Gore and his wife Tipper And the man said Hes come down a long way hasnt heTheres been kind of a series of epiphaniesThe very next day continuing the totally true story I got on a GV to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria in the city of Lagos on the topic of energy And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville And I told it pretty much the same way Ive just shared it with you Tipper and I were driving ourselves Shoneys lowcost family restaurant chain what the man said  they laughed I gave my speech then went back out to the airport to fly back home I fell asleep on the plane until during the middle of the night we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling I woke up they opened the door I went out to get some fresh air and I looked and there was a man running across the runway And he was waving a piece of paper and he was yelling Call Washington Call Washington And I thought to myself in the middle of the night in the middle of the Atlantic what in the world could be wrong in Washington Then I remembered it could be a bunch of thingsBut what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America It was printed in Monterey I checkedAnd the story began Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday quote My wife Tipper and I have opened a lowcost family restaurant named Shoneys and we are running it ourselvesBefore I could get back to US soil David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on  one of them had me in a big white chefs hat Tipper was saying One more burger with friesThree days later I got a nice long handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton saying Congratulations on the new restaurant AlWe like to celebrate each others successes in lifeI was going to talk about information ecology But I was thinking that since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED that maybe I could talk about that another timeChris Anderson Its a dealAl Gore I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on What can you do about the climate crisis I want to start with a couple of  Im going to show some new images and Im going to recapitulate just four or five Now the slide show I update the slide show every time I give it I add new images because I learn more about it every time I give it Its like beachcombing you know Every time the tide comes in and out you find some more shells Just in the last two days we got the new temperature records in January This is just for the United States of America Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees last month was 395 degreesNow I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment  Im kidding But these are the recapitulation slides and then Im going to go into new material about what you can do But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these First of all this is where were projected to go with the US contribution to global warming under business as usual Efficiency in enduse electricity and enduse of all energy is the lowhanging fruit Efficiency and conservation  its not a cost its a profit The sign is wrong Its not negative its positive These are investments that pay for themselves But they are also very effective in deflecting our pathCars and trucks  I talked about that in the slideshow but I want you to put it in perspective Its an easy visible target of concern  and it should be  but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks Cars and trucks are very significant and we have the lowest standards in the world And so we should address that But its part of the puzzle Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference And with what Vinod and John Doerr and others many of you here  there are a lot of people directly involved in this  this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it Carbon Capture and Sequestration  thats what CCS stands for  is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe Not quite there yet OK Now what can you doReduce emissions in your home Most of these expenditures are also profitable Insulation better design Buy green electricity where you can I mentioned automobiles  buy a hybrid Use light rail Figure out some of the other options that are much better Its importantBe a green consumer You have choices with everything you buy between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis Consider this Make a decision to live a carbonneutral life Those of you who are good at branding Id love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people It is easier than you think It really is A lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisisnetThere is a carbon calculator Participant Productions convened  with my active involvement  the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumerfriendly carbon calculator You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are and then you will be given options to reduce And by the time the movie comes out in May this will be updated to 20 and we will have clickthrough purchases of offsetsNext consider making your business carbonneutral Again some of us have done that and its not as hard as you think Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations whether you are from the technology or entertainment or design and architecture community Invest sustainably Majora mentioned this Listen if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance dont ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management Over time people do what you pay them to do And if they judge how much theyre going to get paid on your capital that theyve invested based on the shortterm returns youre going to get shortterm decisions A lot more to be said about thatBecome a catalyst of change Teach others learn about it talk about it The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago except its a lot more entertaining And it comes out in May Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it Consider sending somebody to Nashville Pick well And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow  repurposed with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach and its not just the slides its what they mean And its how they link together And so Im going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse in communities all across the country and were going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week to keep it right on the cutting edge Working with Larry Lessig it will be somewhere in that process posted with tools and limiteduse copyrights so that young people can remix it and do it in their own wayWhere did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arms length from politics It doesnt mean that if youre a Republican that Im trying to convince you to be a Democrat We need Republicans as well This used to be a bipartisan issue and I know that in this group it really is Become politically active Make our democracy work the way its supposed to work Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions  global warming pollution  and trading it Heres why as long as the United States is out of the world system its not a closed system Once it becomes a closed system with US participation then everybody whos on a board of directors  how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation Once its a closed system you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided The market will work to solve this problem  if we can accomplish this Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring We have to change the minds of the American people Because presently the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be doneAnd in our modern country the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did Its now repetition of short hotbutton 30second 28second television ads We have to buy a lot of those ads Lets rebrand global warming as many of you have suggested I like climate crisis instead of climate collapse but again those of you who are good at branding I need your help on this Somebody said the test were facing now a scientist told me is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combinationThats really trueI said the other night and Ill repeat now this is not a political issue Again the Republicans here  this shouldnt be partisan You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do This is an opportunity Not just this but connected to the ideas that are here to bring more coherence to them We are oneThank you very much I appreciate it\n"
